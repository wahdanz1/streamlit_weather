# 🌦️ Streamlit Dashboard - Weather Data

This repository contains a project aimed at building a weather dashboard using ```Streamlit```, ```DuckDB```, and ```dlt```. The purpose of this project is to strengthen my Python skills, gain experience with data handling and visualization, and explore machine learning applications.

## 🚀 Goal
The main goal of this project is to:
- Develop fluency in Python and key libraries (Streamlit, DuckDB, dlt).
- Build a live weather dashboard displaying real-time and historical data using **OpenWeatherMap's API**.
- Implement line and bar charts for data visualization.
- Train a regression model to predict future weather trends.

## 🛠️ Future Plans
- Expand the dashboard to include more detailed weather insights.
- Optimize performance for handling larger datasets.
- Explore additional machine learning models to improve weather predictions.
